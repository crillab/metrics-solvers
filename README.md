# Solver Configuration Collection

This repository provides a curated collection of solver configuration files for use with:

- [Metrics](https://github.com/crilllab/metrics) ([Documentation](https://metrics.readthedocs.io)):  
  An open-source Python library to automate experiments and analyze solver performance.
- [XCSP-Launcher](https://github.com/thibaultfalque/xcsp-launcher):  
  A tool for installing, managing, and executing solvers supporting the XCSP3 format.

These configuration files describe how to install, build, and run various constraint programming solvers.
